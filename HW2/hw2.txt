Although I spent multiple days making my two functions, after all my work
 my two functions still were not functional. Consequently, I changed both 
 my make_matcher and make_parser functions to return "None" so that 
 they compile and can pass a couple trivial test cases. My make_matcher 
 and my make_parser functions are not fully functional. 
 However, in this report I will explain how I attempted (unsuccesfully)
 to implement these functions.

 For make_matcher, I attempted to apply an acceptor and the given 
 fragment frag. This function recursively called on the fragment in 
 order to parse the fragment into prefixes that would be compatible
 with the grammar. After finding these prefixes, it would pass the 
 suffixes into the acceptor function, and return whatever the a
 acceptor function returned. 

 For make_parser, I tried to return a parser for the grammar gram. The
 parser returned an optional parse tree. I first attempted to do this by 
 figuring out what made the parse_tree_leaves function work. Then, I 
 tried to reverse engineer the function so that instead of receiving 
 a tree and outputting the leaves, I was able to receive a list of 
 leaves and output a tree. However, after many hours dedicated to this 
 function, this function was ultimately unsuccessful, hence why I 
 returned None for both functions. 

My warmup questions are completely functional, and hopefully I receive
at least some partial credit for the assignment! :)
