Ambiguous Solutions to a given C: 

Using the predicate call: ambiguous(4, C, T1, T2).

This predicate returned the following ambiguous solutions: 

C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]]


____________________

When running the predicate: speedup(X). 

I would get the answer: 

X = 3.4705882352941178 ?

This ratio is above 1 and shows that the FD implementation
is faster than without it.
